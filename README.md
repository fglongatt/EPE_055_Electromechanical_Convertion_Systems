## Aims

To provide the student with an understanding of power conversion equipment and electrical networks. This includes the knowledge of how to analyse such systems both theoretically through equivalent circuits and practically through laboratory experiments.

## Intended Learning Outcomes:

### 1.Knowledge and Understanding
- Explain the requirements for wound ferromagnetic materials and their practical limitations.
- Describe the principles of operation of transformers and DC and AC machines.

### 2.Subject-Specific - Cognitive Skills
- Analyse electrical networks with both balance and unbalanced loads.
- Calculate power loss and saturation effects in ferromagnetic materials.
- Calculate important design parameters for power conversion equipment: power losses, efficiency, voltage regulation, speed regulation, power factor, torque, force, using equivalent circuit models.

### 3.Subject-Specific - Practical Skills
- Undertake laboratory experiments to understand the operation and key characteristics of electrical power devices including, for example, transformers and machines.

### 4.Key Transferable Skills
- Solve subject specific numerical and conceptual problems.
- Undertake experimental work in an electrical laboratory.
- Present experimental data in a clear and concise manner.
