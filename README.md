# EPE_055_Electromechanical_Convertion_Systems

## Aims

This course is designed to give the student an understanding of power conversion equipment and electrical networks. It includes knowledge of how to analyse such systems both theoretically, through equivalent circuits, and practically, through laboratory experiments.

## Intended Learning Outcomes:

### 1. Knowledge and Understanding
- Explain the requirements for wound ferromagnetic materials and their practical limitations.
- Describe the principles of operation of transformers and DC and AC machines.

### 2. Subject-Specific - Cognitive Skills
- Analyse electrical networks with both balanced and unbalanced loads.
- Calculate power loss and saturation effects in ferromagnetic materials.
- Calculate important design parameters for power conversion equipment: power losses, efficiency, voltage regulation, speed regulation, power factor, torque, and force, using equivalent circuit models.

### 3.Subject-Specific - Practical Skills
- Undertake laboratory experiments to understand the operation and key characteristics of electrical power devices, including, for example, transformers and machines.

### 4. Key Transferable Skills
- Solve subject-specific numerical and conceptual problems.
- Undertake experimental work in an electrical laboratory.
- Present experimental data clearly and concisely.
